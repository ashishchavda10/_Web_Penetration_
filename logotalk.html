       <h1>What do we do?</h1>
       <p>Cybersecurity training is an essential resource for those looking to protect commercial, municipal, or governmental organizations from cyber attacks. Private companies are becoming an increasingly common target for cybercrime, and since employees with weak cybersecurity knowledge are the main entry point for online fraud, viruses, and other threats, it makes sense that business owners and managers should focus on teaching employees the importance of strong digital security.

<br><br>While most companies rely on secure firewalls, centralized defense systems, and experienced IT departments, many companies are tapping into cybersecurity practice labs to improve the overall training experience through increased control, interaction, and scalability.</br></br></p>
